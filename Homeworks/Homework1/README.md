## Python Usage
### assignment1.py
> NOTE: Make sure that the assignment1.py and the stabilityChecker.py scripts are placed in the same directory.  The stabilityChecker module imports an API form assignment1.py, under the assumption that they reside in the same directory

As prescribed in the assignment document, you may run the gale-shapely marriage problem code by running:

```bash
python assignment1.py <Input-filename.txt>
```

Only a relative path is required for the `Input-filename.txt`, since it is assumed that the Input config is either in the working directory, or in either of: `Tests/` and `VerifierTests/`.

For example:

```bash
python assignment1.py Tests/Input0.txt
```

### stabilityChecker.py
To run the script, the command line syntax is as follows:

```bash
# make sure this is ran in the same CWD as assignment1.py
python stabilityChecker.py <InputN.txt> <OutputToBeVerified.txt>
```

The script assumes the current working directory as the root path, so relative paths are supported.  For example:

```bash
python stabilityChecker.py VerifierTests/Input1.txt VerifierTests/OutputToBeVerified.txt
```

## Verification Tests
The verification tests examine three difference scenarios:
    1. The worst-caset scenario (Input0.txt)
    2. The default scenario (Input1.txt)
    3. Scenario 3 (Input3.txt)
In both cases, one output will be the correct output generated by the algorithm, while the other output will be
purposely unstable, to ensure the the `stabilityChecker` can flag instable outputs properly.  The full mapping of the Inputs and OutputToBeVerified, with the expected stability results are shown below:

| Scenario | Output Description | Expected Verifier Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Correct Output | stable |
| 1 | Correct Output | stable |
| 1 | Instable Output | unstable |
| 3 | Correct Output | stable |
| 3 | Instable Output | unstable |

The stability checker results are stored in files called: `./VerifierTests/VerifiedN.txt`
